# Jason's House Rules for Bocce

### Playing

**Throw underhand.** 

For the first round, the winner of a coin flip throws the yellow target ball, called the *pallino*. 

The pallino must go more than half way and can't hit the back wall. If it doesn't go half way or does hit the back wall, the other team gets to try. 

Regardless of who threw the pallino successfully, the starting team throws their first ball. As long as it doesn't hit the back wall, it's the other team's turn. 

If a ball hits the back wall, it's dead. Remove it from the court and the throwing team tries again. 

From that point, the team who does not have the closest ball throws until they have the closest ball or they run out of balls. 

In case of a close call, argue vehemently that your team is closer. Do not back down. 

There should never be a tie during the round (see previous rule), but in the rare case that neither team's ball is closer, the last team to throw continues until the tie is broken or they run out of balls. 

If there's a tie at the end, no team gets a point.

### Scoring

The round ends when all the balls are thrown. Only one team can score points each round. 

The team with the closest ball to the pallino wins the round and scores one point for each ball that's closer to the pallino than the opposing team's closest ball. 

The losing team gets no points that round but throws the pallino first in the next round. 

Start the next round from the opposite side. 

### Back Wall

If the ball you throw hits the back wall, it's dead. Walk all the way over there and remove it from the court. 

If it hits a ball after bouncing back from the wall, place the moved ball back to its original position. 

If you knock a ball into the back wall (with a valid throw or before your ball hits the back wall), the balls stay where they are. You can't knock someone else's ball out of play.
